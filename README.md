# maddjack23

Hello, I'm Jackson Hansen, AKA `maddjack23`, and I'm a software developer living in beautiful Oregon. I've been programming since I was a kid, starting with BASIC and moving on to more sophisticated languages like C, C++, Java, Node, Go, Perl, Python, and Bash.

I love building software that solves real-world problems. I enjoy the challenge of picking up new software frameworks and technologies, and figuring out how to use them to create amazing applications. I believe the right technology stack can make the difference between an average app and an amazing one!

In my free time, I love to take hikes, enjoy the outdoors, and explore the Pacific Northwest in all its glory. I also enjoy photography, woodworking, and playing board games with friends.

Feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions or just want to chat. I'm always happy to help if I can.
